To run your app, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This may include frameworks, libraries, or other software required by your app. To do this run ```npm install```.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your app's code is located. In your case, it would be `/home/clivew/play/azure/test/`.

3. Run with `node app.js`.
